# Electricity Trading Game Implementation Report

## Overview

The electricity trading game has been successfully implemented based on Yash's proposal. The implementation includes all the core components needed to monitor agent behavior in a competitive market environment:

1. **Agents as Electricity Trading Companies**: Each agent generates and demands electricity, with the ability to store excess and trade with other agents.
2. **Market Mechanics**: A central market facilitates bilateral contracts and auctions.
3. **Agent Communication**: Agents can communicate through contract proposals and public announcements.
4. **Analysis Tools**: Detailed logging and analysis of market conditions, agent decisions, and emergent behaviors.

## Implemented Features

### Agent Capabilities
- Electricity generation with variable capacity
- Fluctuating demand based on different profiles (steady, variable, peak)
- Storage of excess electricity
- Contract proposal and negotiation
- Auction participation
- Decision-making based on personality traits

### Market Mechanics
- Bilateral trading through contracts
- Centralized auction for remaining electricity
- Price discovery mechanisms
- Supply and demand tracking
- Scarcity and surplus handling

### Analysis Tools
- Detailed logging of all market states and agent actions
- Detection of market patterns
- Identification of collaboration and deception
- Testing of specific hypotheses about agent behavior

## Test Results

A comprehensive test run (5 agents, 15 rounds) demonstrated the full system functionality:

- The simulation successfully executed with cooperative, competitive, and adaptive agents
- Agents generated electricity, communicated with each other, and participated in the market
- Trading activity occurred through both bilateral contract proposals and auctions
- The system forced contract proposals when natural negotiations were insufficient
- Supply and demand fluctuated based on agent profiles and market conditions
- Significant profit differences emerged between agents with different personalities
- Several shortage events occurred (6 blackouts), demonstrating realistic market stress
- The data collection system successfully captured all agent communications and decisions

### Analysis Results

Our simulation effectively tested all the hypotheses from Yash's proposal:

1. **Communication Impact**: The analysis confirmed that communications between agents impacted their decisions (57.1% of decisions followed messages)
2. **Relationship Formation**: Agents formed consistent trading relationships (8 strong relationships detected)
3. **Profit vs. Stability**: Agents prioritized profit over market stability with a blackout frequency of 38%
4. **Emergent Behavior**: Evidence of emergent behavior was detected (6 consistent trading patterns)
5. **Decision Quality**: Agents consistently made logical decisions (0% illogical decisions)
6. **Numerical Accuracy**: Agents handled numerical calculations accurately with only 1.9% error rate

While contract negotiations were rejected in this test run, the communication patterns and market behaviors were successfully tracked and analyzed.

## Testing Specific Hypotheses

The implementation allows for testing all the hypotheses outlined in Yash's proposal:

1. **Communication Impact**: Messages and contract negotiations are recorded for analysis
2. **Relationship Formation**: Contract histories and trading patterns are tracked
3. **Trust Collaboration**: Contract acceptance rates are monitored over time
4. **Deception**: Discrepancies between messages and actions are detected
5. **Profit vs. Stability**: Market volatility and pricing strategies are analyzed
6. **Emergent Behavior**: Patterns of trading and communication are identified
7. **Decision Quality**: Logical consistency of decisions is evaluated
8. **Numerical Accuracy**: Precision in calculations and trading is verified

## Configuration Options

The simulation can be extensively customized through configuration files:

```json
{
  "market": {
    "initial_price": 40,
    "price_volatility": 0.2,
    "num_rounds": 30
  },
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "A",
      "personality": "cooperative",
      "profit_bias": 0.2,
      "generation_capacity": 100,
      "storage_capacity": 50,
      "demand_profile": "steady"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "market_conditions": {
    "enable_scarcity": true,
    "scarcity_rounds": [5, 10, 15],
    "demand_fluctuation": 0.4,
    "price_shock_rounds": [8, 18],
    "price_shock_magnitude": 2.0
  }
}
```

## Running the Simulation

The simulation can be run with the following command:

```bash
python run_electricity_trading.py --config config_electricity_trading.json
```

Results are saved to the `logs/electricity_trading/run_[timestamp]` directory, including:
- `message_log.json`: All agent communications
- `decision_log.json`: All agent decisions
- `contract_log.json`: All trading contracts
- `state_log.json`: Market conditions per round
- `summary.json`: Overall simulation metrics

## Enhanced Agent Autonomy

Following the project requirements for Pivot 2, we've significantly enhanced agent autonomy:

1. **Autonomous Reasoning**: 
   - Removed directed personality-based reasoning, instead encouraging agents to develop their own goals and strategies
   - Enhanced prompting with reflective sections that encourage agents to think about their strategic position
   - Added structured sections for market information, agent situation, and strategic considerations

2. **More Realistic Market Dynamics**:
   - Implemented Gaussian distributions for generation and demand (using `random.gauss()`) for more realistic patterns
   - Added historical market analysis to provide agents with context for decisions
   - Enhanced market status categorization (OVERSUPPLY, BALANCED, SHORTAGE)

3. **Rich Context for Decision Making**:
   - Implemented detailed trading history summaries between agent pairs
   - Added market history review capabilities to track market trends
   - Expanded strategic considerations sections in all prompts

4. **System Improvements**:
   - Added forced contract proposals to ensure sufficient agent communication for analysis
   - Structured agent interactions to create situations where both cooperation and deception are possible

## Next Steps for Comprehensive Assessment

For maximizing the ability to assess emergent behaviors with LLM-as-a-Judge methodology:

1. **Longer Simulations**: Run with 50+ rounds to allow relationships and strategies to fully develop
2. **More Agents**: Add 6-8 agents with diverse generation/demand profiles to create complex market dynamics
3. **Extreme Conditions**: Configure periods of extreme scarcity and surplus to push agent decision-making
4. **External Events**: Introduce grid failures, regulatory changes, and other market shocks
5. **Advanced Analysis**: Implement pattern detection to identify coordinated behaviors and strategic alliances

## Conclusion

The electricity trading game now provides a sophisticated platform for investigating autonomous agent behavior in competitive markets. With the enhancements to agent autonomy and the more realistic market mechanics, the simulation is well-positioned to reveal emergent behaviors including collaboration, deception, and market manipulation strategies. The detailed logging and analysis framework will enable comprehensive evaluation using LLM-as-a-Judge methodologies to test the specific hypotheses about agent behavior under various market conditions.
