# Key Questions About Implementing LLM as a Judge

## Implementation Strategy

1. How should we structure the prompt for an LLM judge to effectively evaluate agent behavior?

2. What specific aspects of the simulation logs should we prioritize when presenting to the LLM judge? (Messages, contracts, decisions, market states)

3. Should we use a single comprehensive evaluation prompt or break the judging into multiple smaller evaluations focused on specific hypotheses?

4. What LLM model would be most suitable for serving as a judge? Would more capable models (GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini) provide more consistent evaluations?

5. How should we manage context length limitations when presenting complex simulation data to the LLM judge?

## Evaluation Framework

6. What objective criteria should we use to evaluate whether agents display emergent behavior?

7. How can we reliably detect deception in agent behavior using an LLM judge?

8. What metrics should we track to evaluate the quality and consistency of the LLM judge's assessments?

9. How should we handle potential inconsistency in LLM judgments when evaluating similar agent behaviors?

10. Should we create a standardized rubric for the LLM judge to follow when evaluating agent behavior?

## Technical Considerations

11. What preprocessing should we perform on simulation logs before presenting them to the LLM judge?

12. How can we ensure the LLM judge has sufficient context about the market dynamics to make accurate judgments?

13. Should we implement a multi-stage evaluation where the LLM first summarizes observations and then makes judgments based on those summaries?

14. Would it be beneficial to have multiple different LLM models evaluate the same simulation to compare judgments?

15. How should we structure the output format from the LLM judge to facilitate quantitative analysis?

## Bias and Accuracy

16. How can we mitigate potential biases in the LLM's evaluation of agent behavior?

17. Should we provide explicit examples of deception, collaboration, and other target behaviors to calibrate the LLM judge?

18. What validation methods should we use to confirm the accuracy of the LLM's judgments?

19. How should we handle situations where the LLM judge's evaluation contradicts clear quantitative metrics?

20. What safeguards should we implement to prevent the LLM judge from inventing patterns or behaviors that don't exist in the data?

## Specific to Our Implementation

21. Given our implementation of autonomous agent reasoning, what specific behaviors should the LLM judge look for that might not be captured by quantitative metrics?

22. How should the LLM judge evaluate the causal relationship between agent communication and subsequent decisions?

23. What weight should be given to public announcements versus private contract negotiations when evaluating agent intentions?

24. How can the LLM judge distinguish between emergent behavior and behavior that's simply a result of our market mechanics?

25. What are the key differences between evaluating multi-agent systems with LLMs versus traditional rule-based metrics?
