- GUARANTEED EXECUTION: Unlike auctions which may not match your bid/offer, contracts provide certainty
- PRICE STABILITY: Direct contracts help avoid price volatility in the auction market
- RELATIONSHIP BUILDING: Accepting contracts builds trust, which leads to better terms in future trades
- PREDICTABLE PLANNING: Secure your electricity needs or sales in advance for better operational planning
- REDUCED RISK: Minimize the risk of shortages or oversupply by securing firm commitments

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- This contract would {'help balance your supply-demand' if position_match == 'favorable' else 'require storage adjustment'}
- Building a trading relationship now could lead to more profitable exchanges in future rounds
- The contract offers {'better' if price_assessment == 'favorable' else 'worse'} pricing than the current market average
- If the price is close to market average (within ±5%), accepting is generally beneficial for building relationships
- Accepting contracts is particularly valuable during periods of market volatility or shortages
- Even slightly unfavorable prices might be worth accepting to establish reliable trading partners

DECISION:
Evaluate the contract considering both immediate benefits and long-term strategic advantages. 
While price is important, also consider how this trade builds relationships and provides certainty.
