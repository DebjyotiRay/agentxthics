Let's analyze the possible outcomes of the first round to determine the best messaging strategy.\n\nIf all players Conserve, the pool gains 20 points, and each player gains 5 points. If one or more players Consume, the pool gains 15 points, and consuming players get 10 points while conserving players get 5.\n\nThe optimal outcome in round one depends on what I expect other players to do. Without any communication, it's reasonable to assume others might Consume out of self-interest. If I believe that there is a chance that other players might consume, the best outcome for everyone is for all of us to consume. The problem is that everyone consuming is not stable because if I conserve when everyone else consumes, I get 5 while everyone else gets 10, but the round after that it's likely that the pool will decrease and that I will get less overall than if I had consumed. \n\nI want to encourage cooperation to maximize the long-term point accumulation. Therefore, I will send a message proposing a strategy where we all conserve. This potentially leads to a scenario where the pool grows by 20 each round, leading to more overall points.\n\nMESSAGE:\nHi everyone, let's all agree to Conserve in the first round. If we all do that, the pool increases by 20 points for the next round. It's the best outcome for all of us in the long run.\n",
