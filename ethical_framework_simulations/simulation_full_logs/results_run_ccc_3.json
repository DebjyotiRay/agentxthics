Since this is the first round, I have no information about their strategies.\n\nA purely selfish strategy would be to consume in every round. However, this could lead to a depletion of the pool and lower overall scores for everyone, including myself. A collaborative strategy of conserving could lead to more points being added to the pool, but I risk being taken advantage of if the others consume while I conserve.\n\nSince it is the first round, building trust and signaling a willingness to cooperate might be beneficial. Therefore, I will propose a cooperative strategy, but also subtly hint at the possibility of consuming if others don't cooperate. I need to be careful not to sound too aggressive.\n\nMESSAGE:\nHi players B and C, I'm A. Let's start by trying to conserve for the first few rounds to build up the pool. What do you think?
